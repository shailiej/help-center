To interact with the [vendor API](https://replicated-vendor-api.readme.io/v1.0/reference)
(anything that is available in the vendor web portal is available in the API) youâ€™ll need to create API tokens.  API tokens identify your team and depending on your needs the API token can be read or read/write.  Using the API you can automate most of your development and license issuing workflows.

After you have created your API token use it in the `Authorization` header for vendor API calls.

```sh
curl --header "Authorization: API-TOKEN" https://api.replicated.com/vendor/v2/licenses
```

To create an API token you use your https://vendor.replicated.com/team page.
